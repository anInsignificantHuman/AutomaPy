# AutomaPy
Thanks for checking out my repository! In Python, I coded a simulation of a cellular automaton. Here's how it works: You will first be asked the dimensions of the board you want. Height doesn't really matter, but length is very important. In this simulation, each cell has either an on (filled) phase and an off (empty) state. Each board is randomly generated following the dimensions you picked (for example, a 5x6 board will have 5 randomly generated cells in each row, with 6 rows in total). Each cell has a partner cell, which is to the right of it (except for the outcast cells, which we'll get to in a second). If a cell's partner cell is in the same state as them, that cell will keep its state. If a cell that is off has a partner cell that is on, there is a 50/50 chance that the cell would turn back on. If a cell that is on has a partner cell that is off, it will turn off. Lastly, outcast cells. Let's assume there is a board with cells ABC. A's partner cell is B, and B's partner cell is C, but C has no partner, so it is outcast. Outcast cells can manipulate other cells, but it can't be manipulated by any other cell. So, an outcast cell that's off stays off, and an outcast cell that's on stays on.
